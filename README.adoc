== Installation instructions

=== .zshrc

* Open the file `~/.zshrc` and add the following code as explained in the comments.


[source,sh]
----
# Load aliases and functions from dotfiles repository.
# Those lines should be added after (`source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh`).
# (Reason: aliases from `$ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh` might otherwise override your aliases.)
