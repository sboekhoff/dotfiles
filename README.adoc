= My Dotfiles

My dotfiles.



== Installation instructions

* Setup typical folders (`mkdir -p ~/git/github.com/ ~/git/gitlab.com/`)
* Clone this repository (here I use `~/git/github.com/sboekhoff/dotfiles/`)

=== .zshrc

* Open the file `~/.zshrc` and add the following code as explained in the comments.


[source,sh]
----
# Load aliases and functions from dotfiles repository.
# Those lines should be added after (`source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh`).
# (Reason: aliases from `$ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh` might otherwise override your aliases.)
source ~/git/github/sboekhoff/dotfiles/config-zshrc/zshrc.sh
